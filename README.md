Our ASP.NET Web Forms application is a web site for free advertisements for exchange of services without the **mediation of money**.

It has user registration and supports three roles: **user**, **admin** and **banned**.

Each user profile can be edited and it supplies information for the user.

In the Administration menu accessible for the users in admin role is possible to  **edit/delete/update/ban/unban** users or **make them admins**.

The site uses **Master page** for the common layout between the pages and **sitemap** for the main menu. The application also has different
menus for different roles of users.

For the database back-end is used SQL Server and Entity Framework with code-first.

As a base for the application is used the Visual Studio Web Forms template. **Twitter Bootstrap** is used for the styling.

We have a user defined **ASCX user control** - **Notifier** which visualizes messages to the user and another one **ImageFromUrl**, which allows the user to give url of image from the web instead of uploading.

We use **file upload** in the user profiles and in the advertisements.
